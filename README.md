# Gold Badge ConsoleApp Challenges - EFA
###### By Maggie Snader
#### Challenge 1 - Komodo Cafe 
###### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I created a basic application for viewing, adding, and deleting meals from a list of menu items. I added an update method in the repo for future use if needed, though it was not asked for in the prompt.
#### Challenge 4 - Komodo Company Outings
###### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This prompt called for an app to track the cost of company outings. I added a total cost to the 'display all' function. The app is also able to find the total cost of a group of outings by type. This prompt did not call for a delete method, but I added one in the repo for potential future use.
#### Challenge 5 - Komodo Email Greeting
###### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Komodo Insurance wanted to send out ad emails to everyone on their list, sorting them into current, past, and present customers and sending them distinct messages. You can view all of the customers in the database in alphabetical order, showing you their information and the message they will be recieving. Update and Delete methods included as well.
